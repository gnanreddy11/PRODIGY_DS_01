# 🌍 Population Distribution Analysis (1960–2023)

This project is part of my internship Task-01. The objective was to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using real-world data.  
I chose to analyze the global population dataset provided by the World Bank.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Visualize the top 10 most populated countries in 2022 using a bar chart.
- Explore the distribution of country populations using a histogram.
- Practice data cleaning, filtering, and visual storytelling.

## 📁 Dataset Source
- **World Bank Open Data**
- File used: `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_76253.csv` (and metadata files)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights
- India and China are the two most populated countries, each with over 1.4 billion people.
- Most countries have populations under 100 million.
- The global population distribution is highly skewed.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Population_Distribution_Analysis.ipynb` — Main analysis notebook
- `README.md` — Project overview

## ✅ Status
✔️ Completed — Ready to be added to my portfolio and internship report.
